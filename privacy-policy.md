# Privacy Policy for UTM Link Generator

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the UTM Link Generator browser extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our extension.

## Information Collection
The UTM Link Generator extension is designed with privacy in mind and collects minimal data:

1. **Local Storage**: We store your UTM parameter preferences and link history locally on your device using browser storage. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

2. **No Personal Information**: We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or IP addresses.

3. **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics or tracking tools to monitor your usage of the extension.

4. **Permissions**: The extension requires certain permissions to function properly:
   - Storage: To save your preferences and link history locally
   - Tabs/ActiveTab: To access the current tab's URL for UTM parameter generation
   - <all_urls>: To allow the extension to work on any website you visit

## Data Usage
The data stored locally is used solely to:
- Remember your UTM parameter preferences
- Store your generated UTM links for convenience
- Provide a better user experience by saving your settings

## Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data from your device.

## Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on your browser's security measures. We recommend keeping your browser updated to ensure the best protection.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the extension's store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
